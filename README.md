# Many Minesweepers

This project has minimum dev and build setups for different frontend frameworks implementing minesweeper, as a good example of a simple, but not completely trivial, project. Some of the designs aren't _completely_ idiomatic because I wanted them all to share the core gameplay logic functions, but they all give a basic sense of what coding in the framework is like. I want to cover at least

- elm (TODO)
- marko typescript (TODO)
- preact (TODO)
- qwik typescript (TODO)
- react typescript (TODO)
- rescript (TODO)
- solidjs typescript
- svelte typescript
- vanilla JS (TODO)
- vue typescript (TODO)
- no angular because I aint about that

and maybe more as more frameworks come out.
